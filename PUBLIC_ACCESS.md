# Public Access Configuration

This application is configured for public access with no authentication required.

## Current Status: âœ… PUBLIC

### What makes this app public:
1. **No Authentication Middleware**: No login or authentication requirements
2. **Open API Endpoints**: All API endpoints are publicly accessible
3. **Public Robots.txt**: Search engines are allowed to crawl all pages
4. **No Access Restrictions**: No IP restrictions or private routing

### Database Configuration:
- **Database**: SQLite (local file-based database)
- **Location**: `/db/custom.db`
- **Access**: Public read/write through API endpoints

### Deployment Notes:
When deploying to production, consider:
1. **Database Security**: For public deployment, consider using a cloud database with proper security
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **CORS**: Currently configured for open access (`origin: "*"`)

### Files that confirm public access:
- `public/robots.txt` - Allows all search engines
- `server.ts` - Socket.IO configured with open CORS
- No `middleware.ts` file - No authentication middleware
- No auth providers configured in the application

### To keep it public:
- Do not add authentication middleware
- Do not add private route protections
- Keep robots.txt permissive
- Maintain open CORS configuration for API access
